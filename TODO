Problems:

* Multiple editors can be opened (only last opened is saved)

Ideas:

* Make each column scrollable (like Tweetdeck)
* Save when clicking outside text field (how to do this?)

Next steps:

* Normalize paragraph when saving
    * Split into multiple paragraphs on more than one newline
    * Remove single newlines
    * Remove paragraph if text is empty
* Make add button add a "drop target" paragraph type (ala fedrated wiki)
