Problems:

* Multiple editors can be opened (only last opened is saved)
* Factory should drop right into edit mode
* Highlighting of toc rows is not always up to date
* Invalid drop targets are still shown
* Normalize paragraph when saving
    * Split into multiple paragraphs on more than one newline
    * Remove single newlines
    * Remove paragraph if text is empty
* Missing page operations
    * Add (before, after)
* Missing paragraph operations
    * Context menu with add paragraph before/after
* Deleted pages are not removed from workspace

Ideas:

* Only expose custom classes from Document (Page, Paragraph, ...)
* Make each column scrollable (like Tweetdeck)
* Save when clicking outside text field (how to do this?)
* This is really a writing tool
    * Spell checking
* Final test: rewrite rlselect using rliterate
    1. Import all source code as is
    2. Write narrative
    3. Ensure generated files are not changed
* Highlight active page in TOC
