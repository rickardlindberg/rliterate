Next steps:

* Fix drag and drop
    * Application does not exit cleanly
    * Divider is ugly
* Read/Write document to disk instead of the in-memory test data
* TOC operations
    * Add (as child, before, after)
    * Move
    * Indent
    * Dedent
* Normalize paragraph when saving
    * Split into multiple paragraphs on more than one newline
    * Remove single newlines
    * Remove paragraph if text is empty

Problems:

* Multiple editors can be opened (only last opened is saved)
* Title texts animates to bigger when going to edit mode
* TOC does not remember expandedness when re-rendering
* Factory should drop right into edit mode

Ideas:

* Make each column scrollable (like Tweetdeck)
* Save when clicking outside text field (how to do this?)
* This is really a writing tool
    * Spell checking
* Final test: rewrite rlselect using rliterate
    1. Import all source code as is
    2. Write narrative
    3. Ensure generated files are not changed
* Highlight active page in TOC
